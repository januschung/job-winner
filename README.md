## Background

I lost my job right before the holiday season in 2022. I need to look for a new job and apply for as many as I can while all the big techs are laying off talents.

To keep track of job applications:

1. Use Google Spreadsheet (I am using it before this project). It is ugly, hard to maintain and easy to mess up the layout.
1. Use online tool like huntr.co. But it can only track 40 jobs and I don't want to spend a dime for the premium service.
1. Use pen and paper. It works but I can't copy and paste information such as the job url link and utilize it later.

None of the about is fun or totally fit my use case.

That's the reason for me to build something for myself, and potentially you, to get the job done (and to get a new job successfully!)

## Benefit of Job Winner

Job Winner helps you keep track of all your job applications in one placeâ€”totally free! No hidden fees, and you won't have to worry about your personal data being sold.

One of the handy features is the Profile Page. This is where you can store all the personal information that job applications often ask for (like your LinkedIn URL). Plus, it has a super handy feature that lets you copy any field to your clipboard with just a click.

## Components

Job Winner has two components
1. Backend (this repo)
1. [UI](https://github.com/januschung/job-winner-ui)

## About this repo

This is the backend for Job Winner and here is the stack:

1. Java 17
1. Spring Boot 3.4.0
1. Spring Reactive
1. GraphQL
1. Postgres DB

## Build and Run the App with Docker Compose

You have two options for data persistence:
* **PostgreSQL**, a SQL database instance suitable for production releases
* **H2**, a much simpler in-memory store (persisted in a file) that is useful for local testing

### PostgreSQL

1. Build the App with docker compose
```console
docker compose up builder
```
2. Run the App with docker compose. This will initialize the database automatically.
```console
docker compose up -d
```

3. Administer the database:
    * Visit http://localhost:8081/. Information can be found or modified [here](./src/main/resources/application.properties).
        * System: `PostgreSQL`
        * Server: `db`
        * User: `postgres`
        * Password: `example`
        * Database: `postgres`

Please follow the build instruction from the [UI repo](https://github.com/januschung/job-winner-ui) to bring up the UI.

### H2

1. Build the App with docker compose
```console
docker compose up builder
```

2. Initialize the H2 database and run the app (**Do this the first time you run it**)
```console
SPRING_SQL_INIT_MODE=always docker compose up app-h2
```

3. Subsequent runs can skip the initialization:
``` console
docker compose up app-h2
```

Please follow the build instruction from the [UI repo](https://github.com/januschung/job-winner-ui) to bring up the UI.
